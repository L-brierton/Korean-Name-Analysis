# Korean Name Analysis
[WiP] Analysis of Korean Names. 

Korean names were chosen for 3 reasons: 

1. Working in a non-latin script. 
This challenged me to work with text not native to me and develop general strategies for dealing with text in general rather than just Latin text.

2. Translation issues 
I had noticed that during translations of Korean, because the language does not distinguish between gender on the third person pronoun like English and many other european languages (i.e. he/she, il/elle, han/hon) this caused issues using the correct gendered thrid person pronoun when refering to people. I began to investigate and found that a crude understanding (or misunderstanding) of how Korean names work may be to blame. I began to wonder if there was a better way to use a given name to derive the correct thrid person pronoun to use.

3. Unique challenges with Korean names specifically
During my investigation mentioned above, I found that Korean names offer a unqiue challenge due to their historical development. As Korean was written in the Chinese script for many centuries, names themselves are often a Hangul transliteration of Chinese characters (known as Hanja in Korean), with their meaning deriving from the latter. Many Koreans do not use hanja to write their name on a day-to-day basis and the corresponding hanja of any given name may have hundreds of possible variants. This offered a unique challenge.
